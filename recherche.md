# banner / transition from header to body / body to footer

- Currently the header transitions into the body with a "spikey" / fence kind of bar.

I am using a png image file, but it might be solvable with some CSS.

# div / box sizing of the key features

- Currently each box in each row shares the size of the biggest box in the row.

- Not every row has the same height.

- Columns differ in width.
